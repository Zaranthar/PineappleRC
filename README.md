# PineappleRC
 Final Year Project of Pineapple Ripeness Classification


This is my final year project about Pineapple Ripeness Classification using Transfer Learning.

What's included in this repo are the h5 file and the app.py which uses streamlit.

# Prerequisites
Please make sure you have the following installed

1. Python
2. Tensorflow - pip install tensorflow
3. Streamlit - pip install streamlit

# How to use

1. Once everything has been installed open the CMD and target the path to the folder that has both the app.py and the .h5
2. In the cmd type streamlit run app.py; example C:\Users\user\Desktop\PineappleRC> streamlit run app.py

# Final Words

Anyone can use or edit these files. Many thanks to the guides I found online and helped me greatly during creating this model.
